        passionate about leveraging technology to improve user experiences and

        I got my first hands-on experience as an intern at{" "}
        <span className="text-cyan-300">Codeware</span> in Ikeja, Lagos, where I
        created reports, participated in client meetings, and contributed to

        into tech.

        Later, I joined <span className="text-cyan-300">Dimensions Data</span>{" "}
        as a Graduate Trainee, where I worked closely with senior developers,
        fixed bugs, and learned industry best practices through pair programming
        and code reviews. I transitioned into a{" "}

        networks and software.

        As a <span className="text-cyan-300">Frontend Engineer</span> at the
        same company, I led the development of an internal asset monitoring web
        app to track CC1 across client sites. I built dynamic UI components with
        React.js, integrated charts using Chart.js and Recharts, and applied
        solid state management practices. I collaborated with network and
        support teams to deliver seamless UX, and ensured quality with unit and
        integration testing using Cypress.
